I like building things with code, when I finally make something I can truly call my own, I'll lay it out here!
#### HTML & CSS
* One second while I track down my old login page...

#### SQL Database
* Working on it right now, actually...

#### Javascript
* Coming soon!

#### Python
* Sounds fun, I'll get right on that.

#### C\#
* I'm currently more interested in C++, but all in due time.

#### Team Projects
* Stay tuned...
