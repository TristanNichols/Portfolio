### Portfolio Of Tristan

I like building things with code, when I finally make something I can truly call my own, I'll lay it out here!

#### HTML & CSS
* One second while I track down my old login page...

#### SQL Database
* I was asked to make a Library database for tracking book loans from several fictional locations and things of the like, it is all written by me over the course of several days. Alot of it was created to fill parameters given to me, such as "Create at least 40 Books", which would explain the large amount of fictional code. It was a fun excersize and a great learning opportunity.

#### Javascript
* Coming soon!

#### Python
* Sounds fun, I'll get right on that.

#### C# 
* I'm currently more interested in C++, but all in due time.

#### Team Projects
* Stay tuned...
